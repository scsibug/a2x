// the general philosophy in conversion is to keep the ctx on the AST
// side, and generate X-prefixed structs that contain just the
// information needed to output XACML-as-XML.

// The AST structs will have TryFrom implementations (down to the
// level of anything that has a ctx object) that perform conversion to
// the X-prefixed structs.

// The X-prefixed structs will have "write_xml" functions that can
// serialize themselves using an EventWriter.
